## Database Schema Quality Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Covers all aspects of healthcare data management
2. **Flexibility**: Extensible design through attribute tables
3. **Standards Compliance**: Follows healthcare data standards
4. **Audit Support**: Complete audit trail capabilities
5. **Internationalization**: Multi-language and localization support

### Areas for Optimization
1. **Primary Key Inconsistencies**: Some tables lack proper auto-increment PKs
2. **Relationship Documentation**: Could benefit from explicit foreign key constraints
3. **Performance Considerations**: Large tables like `obs` may need partitioning
4. **Normalization**: Some tables could benefit from further normalization

## Deployment Considerations

### Database Requirements
- **Size**: Medium to large database (100+ tables)
- **Performance**: Requires indexing strategy for large clinical data
- **Backup**: Critical healthcare data requires robust backup strategy
- **Security**: PHI data requires encryption and access controls

### Recommended Infrastructure
- **Database**: MySQL/MariaDB (primary), PostgreSQL (alternative)
- **Memory**: 8GB+ for production environments
- **Storage**: SSD recommended for performance
- **Monitoring**: Database performance monitoring essential
