/**
 * Defines a type of relationship between two people in the database. <br>
 * <br>
 * A relationship is two-way. There is a name for the relationship in both directions. <br>
 * <br>
 * For example: <br>
 * a) physician Joe<br>
 * b) patient Bob<br>
 * Joe is the "physician of" Bob <u>and</u> Bob is the patient of Joe. Once you can establish one of
 * the two relationships, you automatically know the other. <br>
 * <br>
 * ALL relationships are two-way and can be defined as such. <br>
 * <br>
 * RelationshipTypes should be defined as <b>gender non-specific</b> For example: A mother and her
 * son. Instead of having a RelationshipType defined as mother-son, it should be defined as
 * Parent-child. (This avoids the duplicative types that would come out like father-son,
 * father-daughter, mother-daughter) <br>
 * <br>
 * In English, we run into a tricky RelationshipType with aunts and uncles. We have chosen to define
 * them as aunt/uncle-niece/nephew.
