/**
 * Care Setting defines the scope of care for any piece of data within the medical record. Clinical
 * data (treatments, notes, etc.) apply within their associated care setting. Implementations
 * working within a single context (e.g., within a single clinic, a set of coordinated clinics, or a
 * single hospital) may use a single Care Setting for all of their data. Implementations providing
 * care across different care settings (e.g., within clinics and within hospital) may need to define
 * multiple care settings in order to, for example, keep orders within one care setting from
 * affecting orders in the other care setting. Active order lists are scoped to a single care
 * setting. In the simplest example, an implementation would define a care setting for each basic
 * type of setting (INPATIENT, OUTPATIENT, EMERGENCY) they use. If an implementation provides care
 * in two separate hospitals that function independently, then they would use two separate care
 * settings like "Hospital A" and "Hospital B".
